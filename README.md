# Search-of-credit
“Credits" - this is my first сonsole Java project. 
With its help, it is possible to pick up a loan listed in the resources/offers.txt. 
For users give the next сonsole menu: 

"Please, choose the option and enter the number:
- enter 1 - show the offers list;
- enter 2 - show the manadgers list;
- enter 3 - sort the offers by term;
- enter 4 - find the offers with defining maximum line;
- enter 5 - write information about bank in the files/bank.txt;
- enter e - exit from program."
